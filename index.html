    </ul>

<h3>Munich</h3>
    <p>Germany's capital is Berlin but I think Munich is a little more exciting. Its home to many different delicious foods like the bratwurst sausage and something called currywurst which is like curry with  sausage. there is also things called eiscaffe which are ice cream cafes </p>

    <h3>Edinburgh</h3>
    <p> Edinburgh is very good for food of different cultures like japanese and chiness etc. But it isnt just good for food its also a great place to go with friends and just look at some of the things that are there like shops or arcades.</p>

    <h3>Tokyo</h3>
    <p>Tokyo is a great place to visit but its also very difficult becasue of the language barrier. Tokyos technological advancements are amazing and everyone there has really good manners because they were brought up like that so it's a very nice country</p>

    <h3>Barcelona</h3>
    <p>Barcelona is the place to go if you want good food and a great tan. The steak houses in Spain are almost unbeatable and will leave you satisfied.</p>
